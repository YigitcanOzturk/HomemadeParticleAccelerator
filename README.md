# HomemadeParticleAccelerator
We used

a geiger counter apparatus for smartphones,
a plastic pipe,
vacuum cleaner for pumping,
high voltage transformator for generating electrons,
coils for generating magnetic field,
a circuit to change dc to ac.

As you see, almost every unit we used and made here completely provided from a limited budget and resources.
